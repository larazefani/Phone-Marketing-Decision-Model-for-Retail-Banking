# Phone Marketing Decision Model for Retail Banking

I developed a classification model that will further refine the bank's ability to predict customer behavior. This model will enable the bank to make data-driven decisions regarding its phone marketing strategy, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively. As a result, the bank will be able to optimize its calling strategy based on the insights generated from my analysis.
